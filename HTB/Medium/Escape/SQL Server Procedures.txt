SQL Server Procedures
Since last year we've got quite few accidents with our SQL Servers (looking at you Ryan, with your instance on the DC, why should
you even put a mock instance on the DC?!). So Tom decided it was a good idea to write a basic procedure on how to access and
then test any changes to the database. Of course none of this will be done on the live server, we cloned the DC mockup to a
dedicated server.
Tom will remove the instance from the DC as soon as he comes back from his vacation.
The second reason behind this document is to work like a guide when no senior can be available for all juniors.

Accessing from Domain Joined machine
1. Use SQL Management Studio specifying "Windows" authentication which you can donwload here:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16
2. In the "Server Name" field, input the server name.
3. Specify "Windows Authentication" and you should be good to go.
4. Access the database and make that you need. Everything will be resynced with the Live server overnight.

Accessing from non domain joined machine
Accessing from non domain joined machines can be a little harder.
The procedure is the same as the domain joined machine but you need to spawn a command prompt and run the following
command: cmdkey /add:"<serverName>.sequel.htb" /user:"sequel\<userame>" /pass:<password> . Follow the other steps from
above procedure.

Bonus
For new hired and those that are still waiting their users to be created and perms assigned, can sneak a peek at the Database with
user PublicUser and password GuestUserCantWrite1 .
Refer to the previous guidelines and make sure to switch the "Windows Authentication" to "SQL Server Authentication".
